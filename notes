:VueJS
    :A front-end library to build javascript applications
    :When a vue instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its "data" object to Vue's reactivity system.
     When the values of those properties change, the vue will "react", updating to match the new values.
     When properties in "data" are only reactive if they existed when the instance is created.
     The reactivity system doesn't track changes when property is passed to "Object.freeze()".
     Vue instances expose a number of useful instance properties and methods. These are prefixed with "$" to diffentiate
     them from user-defined properties.
     Vue instance runs functions called lifecycle hooks, such as mounted, updated, destroyed. All lifecycle hooks are
     called with their "this" context pointing to the Vue instance invoking it

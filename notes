:Promise
    :Asynchronous programming in JS is done with callbacks
    :A promise is an object which can be returned synchronously from an Asynchronous function
    :asyn and await allows to structure promise based code as if it was synchronous
    :A promise may be in 3 possible states: 
        :fulfilled
        :rejected
        :pending
    :A promise is settled if it's not pending(either resolved or rejected)
    :Native JS promises don't expose promise states. Only the function responsible for creating the promise will
     have the knowledge of promise status, or access to resolve or reject
